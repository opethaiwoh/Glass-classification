# Glass-classification
A data frame with 214 observation containing examples of the chemical analysis of 7 different types of glass. The problem is to forecast the type of class on basis of the chemical analysis. The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence (if it is correctly identified!).
